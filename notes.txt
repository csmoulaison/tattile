Actually cool as fuck. Make node networks which are the scope hierarchy of your 
program. One for each file, and one connected one. When editing and bringing up
search, for instance, the structure specific to the file is brought up and search
results are highlighted within their proper node space.

This, along with cool text color highlighting type stuff as well. Maybe also 
introduce the shifting feature to only show within a certain scope at one time.

Maybe "tat" or "tt" or switch back to "jf" for "jeff"?

Every character types remains either brighter or maybe yellow for a time as it 
fades to the final color.

Any frame in which syntax highlighting has been added where it wasn't there 
before, the characters flash.

The right side of the program has utilities, god damn it.

Non-monospace unless there's a reason. Filenames are always monospace for 
consistency.
